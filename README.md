This is what I used for frontend: https://mui.com (this is a react component library)
Some useful templates: https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/
Sourcecode: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/templates

To resolve issues such as:
./src/components/Signup.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '@mui/icons-material/LockOutlined' in '/Users/wangruifan/Desktop/CIS557/fall-2021-project-group-centric-social-network-team-31/pennlobby/src/components'


I did:
npm install material-ui
